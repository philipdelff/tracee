* tracee todo
** ggstamp
*** DONE time arg to support TRUE/FALSE
FALSE is now the same as "", TRUE is the same as NULL, same as Sys.time()
*** TODO misc arg 
** ggwrite
*** DONE Check whether plot exists before trying to write
Currently, writeObj is giving the error which may be confusing
*** DONE support time arg to ggstamp
*** TODO Support misc arg to ggstamp
** writeFlextab
*** DONE Support missing script argument
This will be the same as NULL. Will result in a space in the stamp.
*** TODO Fix line spacing in pptx files
Not sure how to handle this. Currently, the line spacing is 1, and
that seems to work well for png. It would be complicated to have a
separate version of the object for pptx. In stampFlextab we do
#+begin_src R
  ft <- line_spacing(ft, space = 1, part = "footer")
#+end_src
*** DONE Add save argument like in ggwrite
*** DONE Go back to fnExtension once NMdata 0.0.14 is available
*** TODO [#A] Report written file paths 
like ggwrite does
*** Check and summarize unsupported formats
##### currently, we let lapply throw an error when hitting an unsupported format. It would be more
##### elegant to summarize all the formats that weren't supported.
### formats <- intersect(formats,cc(png,html,docx,pptx))
## if(length(formats)==0) {
##     warning("No supported formats requested. Nothing done.")
##     return(invisible(NULL))
## }
