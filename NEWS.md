# 0.0.3
## Changes
* Flextab function names aligned with functions for
  plots. writeFlextab is deprecated and now called
  ftwrite. stampFlextab is deprecated and now called ftstamp. These
  names match ggwrite and ggstamp, respectively.
## New features
* Missing script argument supported in ftwrite.

* ggwrite support multiple formats (new argument aligning with
  writeFlextab) and canvases. In this case, the canvas name will be
  appended to file names.
  
* ftwrite now throws an error in case unsupported output formats
  are requested.
  
* ftwrite support the 'save' argument like ggwrite. 

# 0.0.2
## New functions
* writeFlextab is a wrapper that flextable objects to files including
  a caption (stamp) referencing script path and output filename. The
  stamp is generated by the same underlying function as used when
  generating stamps for plots in ggstamp or ggwrite. stampFlextab is
  equivalent to ggstamp for plots.
  
## Added features
* Objets of class ggmatrix can now be stamped using ggstamp.
